# Project-Rock-Paper-Scissors
Building a Rock, Paper, Scissors JavaScript project was such an insightful journey for me. It was like diving into the core elements of web development – HTML, CSS, and JavaScript – and bringing them to life in a fun and interactive way.

One of the key takeaways was getting hands-on experience with event handling, figuring out how to make things happen on the webpage when users interacted with it. Manipulating the DOM was a game-changer (no pun intended) – dynamically updating elements and creating a seamless user interface became a skill I can now confidently apply elsewhere.

Getting the game logic right was both challenging and rewarding. I found myself knee-deep in conditional statements, figuring out how to make the computer's choice random and how to determine the winner. It was a fantastic exercise in honing my JavaScript programming skills, making me more comfortable with the language.
